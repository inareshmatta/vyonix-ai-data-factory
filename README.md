## 🏗️ The Data Factory Roadmap
Vyonix isn't just an interface; it's a complete **Data Ingestion & Refinery Pipeline**:
1.  **Ingestion (BYOD)**: Native support for Audio, Visual, and Textual data streams.
2.  **Synthesis Engine**: Generate synthetic high-resolution images, vocal assets, and text reports to augment your training sets.
3.  **Precision Refinement**: Human-in-the-loop (HITL) tools powered by Gemini-accelerated labeling.
4.  **Industrial Export**: Download ZIP/JSON datasets ready for **Vertex AI**, **TensorFlow**, or **PyTorch** fine-tuning.
