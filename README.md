Vyonix Studio is a state-of-the-art **AI Data Factory** designed for the modern enterprise. It bridges the gap between raw unstructured data and high-quality AI training sets. Whether you are **bringing your own data** for forensic annotation or **synthesising new data** from scratch, Vyonix provides the industrial-grade pipelines to accelerate your AI development.

## 🏭 The Data Factory Workflow

Vyonix Studio operates as a complete end-to-end data refinery:
1.  **Ingestion (BYOD)**: Upload your own audio, images, or documents for deep structural analysis.
2.  **Synthesis**: Generate high-fidelity synthetic images, text reports, or vocal assets to augment small datasets.
3.  **Refinement**: Human-in-the-loop tools to verify, tag, and redact AI detections.
4.  **Export**: Industrial-standard datasets (JSON/ZIP) ready for fine-tuning your custom models.
