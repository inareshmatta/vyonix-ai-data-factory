## 🎨 Professional Studio Modules

### 🎙️ Audio Intelligence Pro
*Master the phonetic spectrum with industrial precision.*
- **Indian Accent Mastery**: Specifically engineered to handle the rhythmic and phonetic nuances of regional Indian accents and "Hinglish" code-switching.
- **Precision Transcription**: Sub-word level timestamping and speaker diarization via **Gemini 3 Flash**.
- **WAV Header Injection**: Proprietary Node.js logic that reconstructs standard 24kHz/16-bit audio containers from raw PCM streams for instant browser playback.
- **Batch Processing**: Industrial-grade queue management with 50% cost savings using Gemini Batch APIs.

### 👁️ Vision Pro Studio
*Spatial intelligence redefined for surgical labeling.*
- **0-1000 Coordinate System**: Extracts exact normalized bounding boxes for ultra-precise model training.
- **Synthetic Image Generation**: Leveraging **Gemini 3 Pro** to synthesize high-quality training imagery from simple prompts.
- **Interactive Workspace**: Fluid Pan, Zoom, and Draw tools with real-time confidence HUDs.

### 📝 NLP Engine Pro
*Semantic data architecture with audit-grade compliance.*
- **Precision NER & PII**: Automated extraction of 10+ entity types (SSN, Phone, GPE, etc.).
- **Index Self-Correction**: Proprietary snapping logic ensures highlights never drift, matching AI intent to character offsets perfectly.
- **Audit Mode**: One-click redaction layer for PII-compliant data exports.

## 🏗️ Architecture Design (The High-Level Blueprint)

```mermaid

    A[Data Ingestion] --> B{Vyonix Pipeline}
    B -->|Audio| C[PCM Header Injection]
    B -->|Vision| D[0-1000 Normalization]
    B -->|Text| E[Semantic Snapping]
    C & D & E --> F[Gemini 3 Intelligence Layer]
    F --> G[Refined Dataset Export]
```

### **Core Pillars**
1.  **Direct Waveform Analysis**: We process audio directly to capture tonal sentiment.
2.  **Zero-Mutation Workflow**: Detections are stored as vectorized metadata; your raw data stays pristine.
3.  **Model Scrubbing Interceptor**: A secure layer that re-brands all platform metadata as **"Vyonix-Intelligence-Proprietary"**.
